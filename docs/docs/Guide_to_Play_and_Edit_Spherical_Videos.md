In such cases, we need to cover aircrafts to beautify the sky. The tip can be also be used for pictures taken on overcast days.![](../assets/2/14.png)  *Although the sky is blue in this picture, it will be more beautiful if there are clouds.*Open a new project in AE (Adobe After Effects CC2014) and add the video needs to be beautified; Choose a sky material, either picture or video, and place it onto the video you would like to beautify. ![](../assets/2/15.png)![](../assets/2/16.png)  *The sky material is FAIL-...DEO.mp4 and the original video is VID_000...ut.mp4*Use mask and pen tool to sketch the selected material. Keep the sky only. ![](../assets/2/17.png)Adjust feather and mask to reach a natural transition from the sky of the original video to that of the material. Please kindly note that the mask should be enlarged moderately in order not to feather the surrounding materials.![](../assets/2/18.png) To make the sky color more natural, we could also adjust “Effect > Color Calibration > Curves or Hue/Saturation” ![](../assets/2/19.png)Thus the sky beautification is completed! Perfect!As long as the sky is wide and has no complex obstructions, this method can be implemented. Try it!Many other video postproduction software, such as Final Cut Pro on Mac, can do it too.
